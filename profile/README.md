# 👋 Welcome to CCBlueX!

We are a small team of 🚀 developers from Germany with a passion for creating innovative cheats for popular video games. Our primary focus is on the development of LiquidBounce, a popular hacked client for Minecraft 1.8-1.18.2, which has gained a reputation for its superior features and ease of use.

## 🚀 Our Projects

### 🔵 LiquidBounce

LiquidBounce is our flagship project, a powerful and versatile Minecraft hacked client that has become a favorite among gamers worldwide. With features like X-Ray, KillAura, and Fly, LiquidBounce offers unparalleled flexibility and customization, allowing players to tailor their gameplay experience to their preferences.

### 🚀 LiquidLauncher

We also developed LiquidLauncher, an open-source Minecraft launcher designed to make it easy to manage and launch different versions of LiquidBounce. With LiquidLauncher, you can easily switch between different LiquidBounce versions, and manage mods that are guaranteed to be supported. You can also add your own custom mods with ease, making it the perfect tool for modded Minecraft players.

### 🛠️ Tools

We also develop useful tools to make life easier for Minecraft server admins. Our rcon_bruteforcer tool is a powerful utility that enables you to brute force RCON passwords, making it easier to manage and control your Minecraft servers.
